\abstract{In order to develop a comprehensive system model of the Hyperloop transportation system, first steps have been taken in constructing
various baseline models as outlined in Elon Musk's proposal. A completely open-source multidisciplinary framework is provided as a starting point
and the system's design, modeling, and analysis is approached from an aeronautic perspective. The modeling is
focused on the compressor cycle analysis, heat estimates, and capsule geometry. From this analysis, physical limitations of the tube diameter and
capsule geometry have been identified that are not vetted in the original proposal. The results indicate that travel speeds around Mach 0.8 are
attainable, with a tube inner diameter approximately two times larger than originally proposed. In addition, some basic sizing estimates are made to
quantify the effect of the maximum speed on battery sizing and cooling requirements. The estimated on-board power
requirement of 350-425 kw-hrs is in agreement with Musk's original proposal. Conversely, preliminary cooling calculations indicate
 steam tanks to be an ineffective and unnecessary mechanism for managing heat loads between the tube and surrounding environment.}
